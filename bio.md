My name is Eric Ianni. I enjoy many hobbies. I have been running a chainmaille business for a few years. By business I mean I have sold a few things and spent more money than I have taken in. I also do leather working and turn wooden goblets. I have a small farm. By a small farm I mean I don't live in a rural area but have six chickens, two 1000sqft gardens, a mini orchard, and two beehives: this year we will have two alpacas.

Programming Background
I spent three years in high school learning how to program in C++ and Java. It was my favorite subject and I wanted to make it my career. I had grand dreams. I was going to graduate college, perhaps in three years, with a CS degree and land a sweet job. I would live with a bunch of smelly lonely guys and eat chicken and rice. This would allow me to save an insane amount of money. I was going to be able to walk into a Ford dealership with a bag of cash like something out of Miami Vice and outright purchase a Mustang. Then after I had made my fortune I would retire, in my 40's, and take a job teaching CS to high schoolers. I had it all planned out.
