My name is Eric Ianni. I enjoy many hobbies. I have been running a chainmaille business for a few years. By business I mean I have sold a few things and spent more money than I have taken in. I also do leather working and turn wooden goblets. I have a small farm. By a small farm I mean I don't live in a rural area but have six chickens, two 1000sqft gardens, a mini orchard, two beehives, three dogs, two cats, three rabbits, and one fish. This year we will have two alpacas. I would like to blame it on the fact that I married a veterinarian but I can't. Apparently all the animals, except the rabbits and fish, were my idea.
